I couldn’t even expect that managing partners will care about client and project so much, providing support and answering questions 24/7. ",
	"page.home.testimonials.feedbackYuriy": "To be honest, before we met Platinum's team, we didn't realize that our startup needed a lawyer. We were shocked after we spend more than 12 hours together working on the detailed analysis of our project on our very first meeting. There are a lot of nuances as, for example, what to agree first in relations with investors.  The important thing in business is to make money, not to lose them because people are using your legal illiteracy. ",

	"page.defi.defiFaqNew.question8": " What are smart contracts?",
	"page.defi.defiFaqNew.answer8": "A smart contract is a mutual agreement that comes into power with the help of code, once certain conditions are met. The code is not editable and the execution of a contract is automatic, which makes it more secure and hack-proof.",
